# ColorfulAzaleas
A 1.19 Fabric mod that adds really cool azalea trees in a whole bunch of colors! :)

This mod uses a little bit of code based loot tables. The goal of this loot table is to add the colorful azalea saplings to the loot table of the normal azalea leaf.
I wrote this code in such a way that it should not interfere with any other mod that attempts to change the loot table of the azalea leaves.
In the event that the azalea tree does not drop my colorful azalea saplings, you can also craft them by combining the azalea sapling with any dye!

I hope you enjoy this mod, and if you have any questions, feel free to drop in on our Discord: https://discord.gg/NPjsPFEYbN
